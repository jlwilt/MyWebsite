         <p>The  Whitetail Deer, or <em>Odocoileus Virginianus</em> is one of 
            the most widespread large mammals in <br> North America.<span id="habitat"></span> It is often
            hunted as a big game animal. It is a fairly hardy animal, able to live in many environments.

            They can live in many environments, but prefer living in forest 
            environments. Deer especially enjoy coniferous forests in the winter 
            specifically, to shield from tough conditions. They tend to find one
            environment with a sufficient amount of food, then stay there for
            much of their lifetime. They enjoy having many different settings at 
            hand, such as forest, farmland, and high brush (for bedding).

         <h2>Behavior</h2>
         <p>
            <img src="tail.jpg" alt="Whitetail Deer" class="notr" align="right" width=180>      
            Whitetail Deer are very majestic animals, with extremely useful senses, some of which are more powerful than that of humans. Whitetails
            have white tails, hence the name, which act as a "flag" showing their
            alarm when they lift it. This tail allows the fawns to better locate
            their mother.  They are mostly nocturnal/crepuscular, meaning they move
            mainly at dawn and dusk, bedding down in the periods in between. The deer
            mostly bed down in same-sex groups in high grasses and weeds, with places
            near water being even better. They tend to travel in groups of 3 to 5, with the dominant male in the front. 
            They are herbivores, eating corn, lichen, fruits, mosses
            nuts, alfalfa, and especially enjoy soybeans (when available). In the spring
            and summer, they eat green plants. In the fall and winter, however, they eat acorns, 
            other nuts, corn, and woody twigs. Their sense of smell is significantly stronger than humans, and they
            rely heavily upon it. However, their vision is a wide 310 degree angle view
            allowing them to see mostly everywhere around them. They do not see in the same colors as humans,  <span id="characteristics"></span>colors in the blue to dark green range  stick out, with reds and yellows being harder to detect (which is why
            hunters use blaze orange).
         </p>
         <!-- characteristics section -->
         <h2>Characteristics</h2>
         <p>
            Deer are quite lean animals, mostly free of fat, unlike cattle. Whitetails
            weigh anywhere from 37 lbs (16.7 kg) to 340 lbs (154.2 kg).
            They are light brown to tan in the summer, and take on a greyish
            color in the fall and winter.
            <img src="eatingdeer.jpg" alt="Whitetail Deer" class="notr" align="right" width=180>  
            In 3 to 4 months after their birth,
            fawns lose their distinctive white spots. However, nearly all
            whitetails have white under their jawbone, a ring around their nose,
            around the neck, and under their stomach. Males are defined by their
            antlers, a fast growing tissue which are formed starting in the spring.
            They can grow up to 1/2 inches (1.3 cm) a day. While the antlers grow
            they are soft, and are protected by <em>velvet</em>, which is a soft-feeling
            tissue covering them. They shed their antlers in September in most cases,
            and turn hard. The antlers on yearling bucks are<span id="lifecycle"></span>
            like stubs, not yet exposed but poke slightly upwards on the skin, but can
            also be a few inches long (called "button bucks").
            <!-- life cycle section -->
         <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
         <p>
            The deer mating season, or the Rut, starts in late October stretching out
            into early November. In this period the males fight for dominance using their antlers. These fights determine who will mate with the does. The bucks are polygamous, and fighting for dominance ensures that the deer are strong.
            There are typically 1 to 3 fawns born to each doe, and they are birthed in the spring, about six months after the Rut.
            They are born with fur and are able to stand in ten minutes, and walk in seven hours after birth. The mother goes to great lengths to protect her fawns. When she is away, the fawns lay down and stay hidden from predators. 
            Wild deer typically live to three years of age, <span id="diseases"></span>  with captive deer in perfect health can live up to twenty years.

         <h2>Diseases</h2>
         <p>
         <h4 id="headin">Chronic Wasting Disease</h4>
         <p><img src="cwd.jpg" alt="Deer with CWD" class="notr" width="250" align="right">
            Diseases are very important for hunters who are concerned about the welfare of 
            their whitetail herd. One of the biggest diseases destroying previously healthy 
            herds is <strong>CWD, or Chronic Wasting Disease</strong>. CWD is a prion disease that affects
            brain and other functioning of deer mentality. Prions are misfolded proteins
            spread by blood, feces, saliva, and other bodily fluids. The reason this disease
            is such a big deal is due to the fact that any deer can hold this disease for
            up to two years, and then die. The death of infected animals is inevitable,
            and symptoms do not usually show. However, late symptoms do include unusual 
            behavior, such as a reduced fear of humans. They also seem skinny, and sickly,
            and are often very weak around their time of death. While this disease has not 
            been proven to spread to humans who come in contact with body parts, scientists
            have given infected meat to chimps, and some have been infected with the
            disease. The monkey family being closely related to humans, and the fatality rate
            in deer, scientists recommend not comsuming the meat. To prevent the spread
            of CWD, do not transport high-risk parts out of your area. For more information,

         </p>
         <h4 id="headin">Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD)</h4>
         <p>
            Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease is most commonly found in the eastern United States. Outbreaks usually result in 
            the deaths of many deer. <img src="ehd.jpg" alt="Deer with EHD" class="notr" width="250" align="right">
            Whitetail Deer and Mule Deer are the most susceptible to the virus.
            The disease is transmitted through biting midges called "Culicoides". Female midges feed on the blood
            of an infected animal, then feed on another uninfected animal and transmit the disease. Symptoms usually develop
            7 days after infection. These symptoms include a swollen neck, lethargy, weakness, inability to walk, loss of appetite,
            and bleeding ulcers on the tongue and mouth. The tongue may also turn a shade of blue, and hemorrhaging in organs and bodily tissue. 
            Deer usually die within 8 to 36 hours after symptoms show. This disease does <b>not</b> occur in humans.
